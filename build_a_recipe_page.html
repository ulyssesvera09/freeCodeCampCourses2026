    <h1>The ultimate mexican Sopes traditional recipe!!!</h1>
    <p>When a craving hits, look no further than sopes—a quintessential Mexican street food. As a beloved member of the antojitos family, these satisfying corn cakes feature a crispy fried base piled high with flavorful toppings. While often featuring succulent meats, they are just as delicious loaded with grilled vegetables, beans, and fresh salsa for a vegetarian-friendly option.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
      <h4>For the base (Masa)</h4>
      <li>2 cups of corn flour</li>
      <li>1 cup of warm water</li>
      <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
      <h4>Frying & Assembly</h4>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Refried beans</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Make the dough</em>: Mix masa harina, salt, and warm water to form a soft, pliable dough. Cover and rest for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li><em>Shape the sopes</em>: Roll dough into golf-ball-sized portions. Press into thick, 3-inch rounds using a tortilla press or your hands.</li>
      <li><em>Pre-cook</em>: Cook the rounds on a hot, dry griddle or comal for 1-2 minutes per side until just set but not browned.</li>
      <li><em>Form the ridges</em>: While still hot and pliable, pinch the edges to form a shallow rim (like a mini tart shell).</li>
      <li><em>Fry</em>: In a skillet, heat about ¼ inch of oil. Fry each sope base until golden and crisp, about 1-2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
      <li><em>Assemble</em>: Spread a layer of refried beans inside the warm base. Top with your choice of meat, cheese, lettuce, crema, and salsa. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
