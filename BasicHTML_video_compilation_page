        <h1>The last three videos I liked</h1>
        <p>I spend a lot of time watching videos about topics I am interested in.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>Systemd Explained</h2>
            <p>The first one I would like to talk about one from a channel I found last year as I was gaining information on how to migrate from windows to linux. I think, I just like the way this guy explains all topics related to linux distributions and, concretly in this video, some commands to type in the terminal.</p>

            <h2>Missing Semester</h2>
            <p>Last year, I found out these series of videos where they explain how to effectivly use the command line terminal. Thanks to these guys and the community out there I have been able to learn a lot of things.</p>

            <h2>Pumas vs Mazatlan</h2>
            <p>Watching football is one of my favorite activities, even though it is a terribly timeconsuming activity. Nevertheless, I find especially important to support women in fields where men are more relevant.</p>
